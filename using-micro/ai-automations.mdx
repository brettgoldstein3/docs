# AI Autofill

AI Autofill automatically updates properties across your workspace based on new activity, eliminating manual data entry and keeping your data current.

## How AI Autofill Works

You can configure any property in Micro to use AI Autofill. When new emails, calendar events, or other activity occurs, the AI analyzes the context and extracts relevant information to update that property automatically.

## Common Use Cases

- **Auto-label emails** - Automatically categorize emails based on content, sender, or context
- **Pipeline automation** - Move records through pipeline stages based on email activity
- **Contact enrichment** - Update contact properties with information from recent communications
- **Task generation** - Create tasks automatically from email content and deadlines
- **Meeting preparation** - Extract key information from calendar events and attendee data

## Setting Up AI Autofill

<Steps>
<Step title="Select a Property">
  Navigate to any object type (People, Companies, Emails, etc.) and open the properties panel
</Step>

<Step title="Enable AI Autofill">
  Click on any property and toggle "AI Autofill" to enable automatic updates
</Step>

<Step title="Configure Instructions">
  Optionally add specific instructions for how the AI should interpret and extract data for this property
</Step>

<Step title="Test and Monitor">
  The AI will begin automatically updating the property based on new activity. Monitor results and adjust instructions as needed
</Step>
</Steps>

<Note>
AI Autofill works best with clear, descriptive property names and specific instructions about what information to extract.
