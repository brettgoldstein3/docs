<Tip>These quick messages help maintain professional communication without interrupting your workflow.</Tip>

# Meeting Preparation

Kick off an intelligent meeting preparation agent that:

- **Researches attendees** - Gathers background information on meeting participants
- **Prepares briefing materials** - Creates relevant context and talking points
- **Suggests conversation starters** - Provides icebreakers and discussion topics

<Tip>Use the meeting prep agent before important client meetings or sales calls to ensure you're fully prepared.</Tip>

# Calendar-Driven Automations

## Pipeline Updates

Calendar updates automatically trigger changes to relevant records in your app:

For example, when you book a call with a lead in a fundraising or sales pipeline, Micro will detect the meeting and automatically move the record to the proper stage.

<Note>Calendar events with pipeline contacts are automatically linked and tracked for better relationship management.</Note>

# Calendar Activity

Calendar data is visible by workspace members in a few places

- **Activity** - on companies and people profiles 
- **Calendar Properties** - last meeting, next meeting


<Tip>Calendar activity helps your team stay informed about your schedule and availability for better coordination.</Tip>
