# Quick Search with Command-K

Command-K is the ultimate universal search. As you type, it shows the most recent and relevant objects (people, companies, emails and more) to your query in real time.

From there you can do three things:
- Navigate to a search result
- Open full page keyword search
- Run an agentic semantic search


# Full Page Keyword Search

Command-K is default keyword search, but you can click "Seach" to open a full page view with tabs for different objects

Here you can apply filters like you would in other search products.



# Agentic Semantic Search

Micro AI makes it easy to find those things you can't quite seem to find a keyword for.

## How It Works
1. Type a natural language query** in Command-K and press "AI Search"
2. Micro AI interprets your intent and finds relevant content
3. A new AI chat window is opened up where the final search result is shared with explanations for each item
4. You can reply right there to refine your search.

## Example Queries
- "Emails from last week about the project proposal"
- "Show me all tasks related bugs for high priority deals"
- "What documents mention quarterly planning?"
- "Engineers in NYC who worked at Notion"
- "People I messaged on Linkedin about fundraising last week"

<Note>Semantic search understands context and relationships between objects, making it easier to find what you're looking for even with vague queries.</Note>

# What can you search?

All objects that you have access to whether they're private to you or shared in your workspace are searchable.

Semantic search across 1000+ connected apps is coming soon.


# Best Practices

## General
- Start with basic Command K search when possible
- Use filters in the keyword search page to refien your search

## Semantic Search
- Use this more for abstract queries (keyword search will work for everything else)
- Start with simpler queries then add more filters through chat
