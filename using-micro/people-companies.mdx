# Import and Enrich Your Connections

Micro automatically imports all people and companies you've interacted with across email, calendar, LinkedIn, Twitter, and any CSV imports. Everyone in your workspace shares their contacts with each other by default.


All profiles come with comprehensive data enrichment out of the box.

<Tip>All this data is automatically enriched and updated, giving you comprehensive profiles without manual work.</Tip>

<Note>Connection intelligence currently applies to individual users only, not at team or workspace level.</Note>

# Unified Profiles

All company and people profiles are automatically merged:

- **Multiple domains** - Companies with multiple domains appear as one company
- **Multiple emails** - People with multiple email addresses appear as one person
- **Cross-platform data** - Data from email, LinkedIn, Twitter is unified

But when automatic merging isn't perfect, you can manually merge identities:

1. **Update email addresses** - Add new email addresses to existing profiles
2. **Update social links** - Add new social media profiles
3. **Automatic merging** - Micro will merge the objects for you

<Note>Manual merging helps ensure data accuracy when automatic detection misses connections between profiles.</Note>

# Creating New Profiles

You can create new companies and people by creating new objects in Micro.

Micro maintains a global knowledge graph of people and companies that autocompletes when you add profiles from it.

To ensure Micro can match profiles you add, always include one of the following
- Email addresses or domains 
- Social linsk
