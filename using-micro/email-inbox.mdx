# Customizing Your Email Experience

## Email Properties

Email properties help you organize and categorize your messages beyond the standard subject and sender fields.

Default properties include Labels, To, From, Followup, and more - you can edit these or add your own.

Learn more about properties [here](/using-micro/objects-properties)

### AI Autofill / Magic Properties

Most properties on emails can be automatically updated by AI. You can use this to automatically label emails or extract other data.

To activate this, just turn on AI Autofill on the property.

You can learn more [here](/using-micro/ai-automations)

## Creating Custom Email Views

Custom views let you create filtered inboxes for different workflows. 

Some examples of views you can create:
- **Investor Emails** - Filter by investor domains or specific VCs
- **Customer Support** - Emails from customers needing help
- **Team Communications** - Internal team discussions and updates
- **Follow-up Required** - Emails that need responses or next steps
- **Fundraising Updates** - Updates from investors, accelerators, or advisors
- **Sales Inquiries** - Potential customer or partnership requests
- **Urgent Messages** - High-priority emails requiring immediate attention

To create a new view, simply click the plus on the views tab.


# How Email Powers Micro

## Email in Apps

You can view a filtered inbox of all emails from people tied to records in any app. 

Learn more [here](/using-micro/apps-crm)


## Email on Profiles

You can also see all emails tied to a specific person or company on their respective profiles. 

Learn more [here](/using-micro/people-companies)

## Contact Enrichment

Every time you receive an email (or calendar event) from an email address you haven't interacted with before, a new person (and company if relevant) record is created and enriched with dozens of datapoints.

New email and calendar activity is used to update properties on these contacts like Relationship Strength.


## AI Autofill
Emails can be used to autofill properties of other objects. This is especially useful for automating pripelines and other workflows when relevant communication occurs.

### AI Chat
You can ask the Micro AI chat assistant questions about recent emails and have it generate a summary of the most important emails for you to respond to.

You can learn more about both of these AI features [here](/using-micro/ai-automations)

## Cross-Platform Integration

Email data appears throughout Micro:



# Email Sidebar

In the sidebar on every email, you can see a set of Micros:
- **Thread Summary** - Click to summarize the entire thread.
- **Info** - Basic properties tied to the email thread.
- **In This Thread** - Profile cards for everyone in the thread.
- **Task** - Tasks you've created or generated that are tied to the thread
