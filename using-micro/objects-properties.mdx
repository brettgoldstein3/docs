# What are Objects?

Objects are the fundamental building blocks of Micro. Every piece of information - people, companies, emails, tasks, documents, and more - is stored as an object with properties.

## Standard Object Types

- **People** - Contacts and individuals
- **Companies** - Organizations and businesses
- **Emails** - Email messages and conversations
- **Tasks** - Action items and to-dos
- **Documents** - Files and content
- **Events** - Calendar events and calls

Soon you will also be able to create custom objects to model any workflow you may have.


## Object Relationships

You can connect objects to each other by adding them in reference properties on a given object. This is done automatically when you add tasks and docs from profiles for example.



# Understanding Properties

Properties are the characteristics and data points that describe each object. They can be simple text fields, dates, numbers, or complex relationships.

## Standard Properties

Every object comes with standard properties:

- **Name** - Display name or title
- **Created At/By** - When the object was created
- **Updated At/By** - Last modification time

## Property Types

Micro supports the same property types as Notion, plus powerful reference properties for every object type:

### Basic Property Types
- **Text** - Names, descriptions, notes, single line or multi-line
- **Number** - Quantities, scores, ratings, currency, percentages
- **Date** - Due dates, meeting times, milestones, with time options
- **Select** - Status, priority, category, single choice from options
- **Multi-select** - Tags, categories, multiple choices from options
- **Boolean** - True/false, completed tasks, yes/no fields
- **URL** - Website links, social media profiles, external resources
- **Email** - Email addresses with validation
- **Phone** - Phone numbers with formatting
- **Team Member** - References to people in your workspace
- **Created time** - When the object was created (automatic)
- **Last edited time** - When the object was last modified (automatic)
- **Created by** - Who created the object (automatic)
- **Last edited by** - Who last modified the object (automatic)

### Reference Properties
Reference properties link objects together, creating powerful relationships:

- **People references** - Link to specific people in your workspace
- **Company references** - Link to companies in your workspace
- **Task references** - Link to related tasks
- **Document references** - Link to related documents
- **Email references** - Link to specific emails
- **Calendar event references** - Link to meetings and events


<Tip>Reference properties are especially powerful - they automatically update when referenced objects change and enable complex filtering and organization.</Tip>


## AI Autofill

Micro uses AI to automatically fill properties with relevant information from your data:

### Automatic Autofill

Properties can be automatically updated when new emails, calendar events, linkedin DMs, and more come in. This is a powerful tool to automate your pipelines.

### On-Demand Autofill

You can also update a property automatically by clicking the magic wand icon. Micro will do an agentic search to find the right information to update the property.


You can learn more about AI automations in the [AI & Automations](/using-micro/ai-automations) section


## Creating Properties

You can create custom properties from any object

1. **Navigate to Properties drawer for an object or a column in grid view** - Find the object type you want to customize
2. **Add new property** - Click "Create Property" or "+"
3. **Choose property type** - Select from available types
4. **Configure settings** - Set name, description, format, options
5. **Changed are automatically saved** - And you're done!

Here are some best practices when creating properties.

- **Use clear, descriptive and consistent names** - Avoid abbreviations
- **Don't overdo it** - Don't make too many properties as they get hard to manage
- **Consider what object to put the property on** - If its something you want to track across different apps, put it on the main object. Otherwise bias towards putting the property on the app record.

<Tip>Well-designed properties make your data more organized, searchable, and useful for automation and insights.</Tip>



# Using Objects & Properties

You can leverage custom properties to filter and sort views of objects in a more nuanced way. You can even filter objects based on properties of connected objects.

Properties are also helpful for semantic search - the more data captured in properties the more accurate semantic search can be.

Objects and properties form the foundation of Micro's flexible data model, allowing you to organize information exactly how you need it.
