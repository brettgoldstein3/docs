# Core Functionality

Docs and Tasks in Micro work like your favorite document editors - Notion, Google Docs, and more. You can compose text in Markdown, add tables, images, and videos. All Docs and Tasks are objects in Micro with properties, just like everything else in the platform.

You can create a document or task from Command K or by hitting "New" on the Doc or Tasks app.

# Properties & Organization

Every Doc and Task comes with standard properties out of the box:

- **CreatedAt** - When the item was created
- **UpdatedAt** - Last modification time
- **Status** - Current state (for tasks or docs)
- **Priority levels** - High, Medium, Low
- **Labels** - Can be set to anything you choose
- **Due dates** - For tasks
- **Assignees** - Team member ownership
- **References** - Objects like emails, companies and people connected to the doc or task

You can also add any number of additional custom properties.

# Views & Filtering

Docs and Tasks are viewable in apps like other objects in Micro with full flexibility to configure view type (kanban or list), filters and sorts.

<Tip>Use custom properties and filtering to create organized workflows that match your team's processes.</Tip>

# Task & Doc Micros

Task and Doc Micros are widgets that appear throughout the product.

You can learn more in our [Micros guide](/using-micro/micros).

# Live Collaboration & Sharing

Docs and tasks have live collaboration capabilities built in, so you always know when someone is editing a document you shared.

But tasks and Docs are private to you by default unless created in an app that has been shared with others. 

You can learn more in our [collaboration and sharing guide](/using-micro/collaboration-sharing).

# AI-powered Task Generation

AI autofill also works on objects like tasks, which allow you to automatically generate a list of suggested tasks from certain emails.

Any task generated from or created from an email gets automatically tied to the email so you can go back to it later.

You can learn more in our [AI automations guide](/using-micro/ai-automations).  

# Document & Task Apps

You can create specialized document and task based apps for projects, knowledge management and more. Learn more in our [apps and CRM guide](/using-micro/apps-crm).
