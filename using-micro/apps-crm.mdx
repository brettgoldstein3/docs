# What are apps?

Micro is designed to allow you to create apps for any workflow you can imagine, on top of your data from email, calendar, messaging, and more. Today, Micro is most useful for CRM and pipeline tracking style apps. Each app is defined by its base object, which means there are four types today:

# Types of Apps

## People Apps
People apps help you track contacts in a pipeline. They work the same as applicant tracking systems or lead lists in CRMs.

People apps are very similar to CRM and are essentially the same as lists you would find in a modern CRM.

## Company Apps
Company apps help you track different types of businesses in a pipleine. Again, these work the same as standard CRMs.

Common use cases are sales, fundraising, partnerships, deal flow, and portfolio company tracking.

Replaces: Salesforce, Hubspot, Attio.

## Task Apps
Task apps help you organize and track work across different projects and teams.

Replaces: Asana, Linear, Todoist, Trello.

You can use these for project management, engineering ticket management, content creation, and more.

## Document Apps
Document apps provide structured organization for your knowledge and content.

Common use cases are knowledge management and project management.

Replaces: Notion, Coda.


## Deal Apps and More

We will include more stanard objects out of the box (deals, users, workspaces, etc) and allow you to make apps from them.

Deal objects in particular will allow you to create apps to track progress of multiple deals within a single company, as well as in fundraising scenarios - whether hiring or fundraising from an angel or a fund itself.

We will also allow you to create apps from custom objects or no object at all.
