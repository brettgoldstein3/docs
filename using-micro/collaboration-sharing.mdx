# What Can Be Shared

# Sharing Apps

Apps are the primary way to collaborate in Micro. By default, all apps you create are shared with everyone in your workspace, but you have full control over sharing settings.

## Default Sharing Behavior

When you create a new app, it's automatically shared with all workspace members. This ensures your team can access important workflows like fundraising, sales, or hiring pipelines.

## Customizing App Sharing

You can modify sharing settings for any app:

<Steps>
<Step title="Access App Settings">
  Open any app and click the settings icon in the top right
</Step>

<Step title="Modify Sharing">
  Click "Sharing" to see current sharing settings
</Step>

<Step title="Choose Collaborators">
  Select from these sharing options:
  - **Private** - Only you can see and edit the app
  - **Workspace** - All workspace members can access (default)
  - **Specific People (Interal or External)** - Share with individual workspace members or people outside your workspace
</Step>

<Step title="Choose Access">
  Select from these sharing options:
  - **View Only** - Other people can only view the app
  - **Edit** - Full edit access
</Step>

<Step title="Save Changes">
  Your sharing settings are applied immediately and any invites will be sent.
</Step>
</Steps>

## External App Sharing

When you share an app with someone outside your workspace, they'll receive an email notification with a link to access the app. The shared app appears in their "Shared" section at the bottom of the left sidebar. They must accept the invitation to access the app.


# Sharing Contacts

All contacts from your connected accounts (email, LinkedIn, etc.) are automatically shared with all workspace members. This includes:

- **People profiles** - Names, email addresses, social profiles, enriched data
- **Company profiles** - Company information, industry data, employee counts
- **Activity feeds** - High-level activity like "had a meeting" or "sent an email"
- **Relationship data** - Connection strength, last contact, etc.

Email and message content is not directly shared. 

# Live Collaboration

Micro provides real-time collaboration features that let you see your team working alongside you. When multiple people are viewing the same content, you'll see:

- **Presence indicators** - Small avatars showing who's currently viewing the page
- **Activity highlights** - Visual indicators when someone is editing

Micro's collaboration features are designed to make teamwork seamless while respecting your privacy. Start with the default sharing settings and customize as your team's needs evolve.
