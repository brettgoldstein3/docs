## Accessing Billing Settings

You can access your billing settings by clicking on your workspace name in the top left corner and selecting "Billing" from the dropdown menu.

## Current Pricing Structure

Micro is currently priced at $30/month per user. Each team member will need to sign up with their own credit card for now, as we don't currently offer team payment plans.

<Note>
We're actively working on team payment plans and will announce when they become available. For now, each user manages their own subscription.
</Note>

## Payment Methods

- **Credit Cards** - We accept all major credit cards
- **Individual Billing** - Each user manages their own payment method
- **Monthly Billing** - Charges are processed monthly
