# How Accounts Work in Micro

Every user has one account that spans across all workspaces. Your account contains your personal data, integrations, and settings that follow you regardless of which workspace you're in.

## Account vs. Workspace

- **Account** - Your personal profile, data, and integrations (private to you)
- **Workspace** - Shared team environment with collaborative data and settings

You can be a member of multiple workspaces while maintaining one unified account.

# The Account Section

The section above "Apps" that includes Home, Inbox, Contacts, Tasks, and Docs is your personal account section. Only you can see this data, and it contains all information available to your account regardless of which workspace you're currently viewing.

## What's in Your Account Section

- **Home** - Your personal dashboard and overview
- **Inbox** - All your emails from connected accounts
- **Contacts** - Your personal contact database
- **Tasks** - Your personal tasks and to-dos
- **Docs** - Your personal documents and notes

<Note>
This data is private to you and not shared with workspace members unless you explicitly share it.
</Note>
