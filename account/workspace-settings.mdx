## Data Sharing in Workspaces

### Default Sharing Behavior

By default, all contacts are shared with workspace members, but emails remain private. Team members can see:

- **Shared contacts** - All people and companies in your workspace
- **Activity feeds** - Recent interactions, meetings, and updates
- **App data** - Records in shared apps and pipelines
- **Documents and tasks** - If explicitly shared

### Email Privacy

Email content and threads remain private to individual users. Team members can only see:

- **Email activity** - Who sent/received emails and when
- **Email properties** - Custom properties you've set on emails
- **Email metadata** - Subject lines, dates, and participants

<Note>
You control what's shared with team members through Micro's permission system. Learn more about collaboration and sharing [here](/using-micro/collaboration-sharing)
</Note>

## Workspace Permissions

Currently, all workspace members have equal access to shared data. More granular permission controls are coming soon, including:

- Role-based access control
- Custom permission levels
- Data visibility controls
- Admin-only settings
