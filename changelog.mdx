  # Beautiful New UI & Dashboards

  Here are some of the biggest things we launched since our last email to you:

  ## 🎨 NEW UI
  Micro has a beautiful new UI centered around cards which should make navigation super intuitive! Check out the screenshots below or open the app to see :)

  ## 💻 Home Dashboard
  Home is where you start you day and go to when you want a quick birds-eye view of what's going on. Today it features:

  - Daily Summary
  - Important Emails
  - Recent Connections
  - Tasks Due
  - Notepad
  - Recent Documents
  - Email Activity

  ## 📱 App Dashboards
  Every app also has a home page with a similar overview of what's going on for that particular app whether its fundraising, hiring, deal flow, etc. It includes:

  - Daily Summary (from just activity in the app)
  - Emails that Need Response (from just contacts in the app)
  - Tasks Due (from just contacts in the app)
  - Funnel Graph
  - Recent Documents (from just contacts in the app)

  ## 👨 Profile Dashboard
  Profiles also have a home page! You may see the pattern here.

  **Companies include:**
  - Profile card
  - Properties
  - People
  - Org Chart
  - Emails that Need Response

  **People include:**
  - Profile card
  - Properties
  - All Emails
  - Tasks Due
  - Recent Docs
  - Emails that Need Response

  ## ✅ Full-page Tasks
  You can now create full-page tasks that have markdown and everything just like linear! This is a huge quality of life improvement and more is on the way.

  By the way you should definitely transfer your meeting notes to Micro! It's magical

  # AI Web Search & Context Switching

  Here are some of the biggest things we launched since our last email to you:

  ## 🌐 AI Web Search Autofill
  We're excited to bring you the power of perplexity right within micro!

  Now you can click a button to find information from the internet to fill any property!

  ## 📨 Emails, Tasks, and More on Apps
  It's hard to stay on top of communications and next steps for your fundraise or sales when they're mixed up with everything else.

  So we launched views within apps for Messages, Tasks, Docs, Attachments & Links which gives you a filtered view of each of these items connected to people or companies in a given app!

  ## 🤖 AI Auto Add
  Now you can automatically add new records to an app when new activity is detected! That means inbound or outbound emails to investors or customers get automatically added to the right app.

  ## 🔗 Links & Attachments
  Looking for that one document or google sheets link someone sent you? Instead of searching across your emails to find it, now you can just view all links and attachments associated with a given person or company!

  This should make it insanely easy to find what you're looking for and completes the trifecta - links, files, and native documents!

  Note that links are only available on a go-forward basis right now!

  ## 💌 Email Address Types
  People should be treated differently than broadcast emails or automated system emails. Now they are thanks to some intelligent tagging of email address types.

  Where you'll see this in the product:

  - Only human emails will trigger AI autofills and task extractions
  - Human emails will show a circle while Group / System emails will show a square for the avatar
</Update>

  # 🚀 AI Properties & Native Documents

  Here are some of the biggest things we launched since our last email to you:

  ## 💰 Stripe Integration
  Micro is now paid! For now we're charging $30/mo per user, but will be experimenting with pricing as we go, including launching freemium and enterprise tiers as well as credits. Please let us know if you have any thoughts or feedback.

  ## 🤖 AI Properties
  We all hate manually updating stuff in our CRMs and other workflow tools. Now you don't have to!

  Most properties now have an AI autofill setting that when turned on uses the description of the property (and any values) plus any additional instructions you include to automatically update the property when there's new email or event activity.

  This means records in your pipeline can automatically move to the right stage, show you next steps, and more!

  These are active by default in all template apps. Give it a try!

  ## 📄 Native docs in Micro
  You can now create documents with super rich markdown functionality right from within Micro! Use this to add meeting notes, draft up agendas, or whatever!

  ## 💻 Document & Task Apps
  Want to create a simple knowledge repository for your team? Maybe a project management tool to track marketing or engineering efforts? This would be totally impossible in any other CRM let alone email client.

  As of today, it's now possible in Micro. Go try one of our templates to see for yourself :)

  ## 😎 Profile clean up
  We pushed a bunch of updates to make profiles even better:

  - **Simpler activity feed** - We added some color coding to the activity types, event hover cards, and added a filter so you can hide emails
  - **Better connection intelligence properties** - The actual events and emails are now referenced in these properties. They also now apply to companies
  - **Documents and Tasks section** - You can now add documents and tasks that are tied to specific people and companies
  - **Improved property usability** - Properties should look and feel better to use

  ## 💌 Email experience upgrade
  We made a ton of awesome updates to emailing in Micro:

  - Fixed some email rendering & sending/receiving issues
  - Updated the list view UI
  - Added ability to compose new emails (lol finally!)
  - Added ability to see email across inboxes in Inbox app

  We know there's much more to improve for email and we'll continue to make steady improvements as we go!

  ## 👇 Import from Investors
  When you create any new Company-based app (like Fundraising) you can automatically add all investors (or just Pre-seed/Seed) from your contacts. As a reminder you can still add any person or company from the People or Company apps just by selecting them.
</Update>

  # 🚀 Grid View Overhaul & App Templates

  Here are some of the biggest things we launched since our last email to you:

  ## 🤌 Grid View Improvements
  Our grid needed some love so we gave it to some! The grid view in Micro should now work like most other grid products you know and love like Notion tables, Airtable, and Sheets.

  ## 🎃 App Templates
  Our vision is for there to be a "Micro app for that" - whatever it may be. We took the first major step towards that vision launching a few apps that should help you run your startups!

  - **Fundraising (VCs)**
  - **Fundraising (Angels)**
  - **Recruiting**
  - **Sales**
  - **Partnerships**

  Each app comes with properties and stages set up by default. Eventually we'll also help you import into these easily.

  One important note is that in moving to this new approach to apps, the Fundraising App is temporarily not automated. We are working on a few features that will allow you to automatically add and update records as the legacy fundraising app did, but this won't be available for a few weeks.

  ## ✨ 10x Better Data Enrichment
  We've added two new data sources to Micro - **Crunchbase** and **LinkedIn**. That means the people and companies in your contacts now have dozens of datapoints.

  We've also added new data points to connection intelligence for people.

  ## 🦾 Batch Actions
  Now its easy to take action on a bunch of records at the same time. Main use case here is adding records to apps or updating their stage but we'll be expanding functionality so you can do almost anything!

  ## 🧠 Import from CSV
  We know you have your pipelines in other tools so we built an easy way for you to import them to Micro.

  ## 🐛 Tons of bug fixes and minor improvements
  We admit it. The app needed (and still needs) a lot of love in general. This month we kicked off a ton of work to dramatically improve the overall usability of the product.

  # 🚀 UI Makeover & Quick Search

  Here are some of the biggest things we launched since our last email to you:

  ## 💅 Makeover
  Micro was nice but not at the A+ level we wanted it to be at, so we took a few days to clean up UI and fix critical bugs. This included:

  - **Dark Mode Revamp** - Much sexier and readable. This has become my go-to theme
  - **Density** - Now you can switch between our new standard view (which is much more compact and information dense) and a relaxed, less compact view. Check it out in settings in the bottom left
  - **Tasks Glow Up** - Tasks (especially the kanban view) now has a sleek new look that makes Linear look like it was made by a design student
  - **Company/Person Card Upgrade** - We replaced the company/person header cards with something a little more familiar and pleasing to look at
  - **Better Badges** - These things are just much easier on the eyes

  ## 🔎 Quick Search
  Micro is the best product to get context on people you've interacted with over email and calendar, and now it's **THE FASTEST**.

  With the new Quick Search (precursor to a more full-featured Command Bar) you can type the name of a person or company you want to look up and instantly navigate to their page.

  No more trying to remember email addresses or sifting through random emails!

  ## 🏃‍♀️ Quick Filters
  Our email filter system makes Micro incredibly powerful - you can create incredibly specific views of emails based on a range of properties in seconds (which would take minutes in another email client).

  To ensure Micro is still dead simple to use, we created Quick Filters, which automatically sort out the most common emails you'd want to - Spam, Done, Sent, and Trash. Soon you'll even be able to easily filter out those pesky Sales emails (that I often send lol).
</Update>

  # 🚀 Multi-App Support & Connection Intelligence

  Here are some of the biggest things we launched since our last email to you:

  ## 💻 Create New App Flow
  So far Micro was only used for Fundraising, but now you can create new apps (some call these lists or bases) for use cases like Sales, Hiring, and more!

  Just click the plus button, select the fundraising template or a custom app, fill in the details and you're good to go!

  ## ❤️ Connection Strength
  Ok so you have a lot of people in Micro - how do you filter them all? 

  Now every contact has a property called **Strength** which is calculated based on all of your activity (meetings, emails, etc) and tells you how strong your connection is with them!

  ## 👋 Improved Onboarding
  Now we have this cute colorful onboarding flow for all new users that drops you right into the product! No waiting room anymore.

  ## ✨ Default Views
  We know it's hard to set up Micro to take full advantage of its power so we created default views for every app. We'll add to these over time so you can use Micro most effectively with as little effort as possible!
</Update>

<Update label="June 26, 2024" description="v1.3.0">
  # 🚀 Advanced Views, Email Overhaul & Beta Micros

  Here are some of the biggest things we launched since our last email to you:

  ## 🏃‍♀️ More Advanced & Prettier (Custom) Views
  We overhauled our app UI so that across Fundraise CRM, Tasks, AND Email (see next), you can:

  - Update the display type to list, kanban, or grid (for some)
  - Add and display properties of any type
  - Filter and sort based on any property
  - Create custom views with the above settings saved

  Also it goes without saying that the UI is just much prettier than it was before.

  ## ✉️ 10000x Better Email Experience
  Ok we started Micro as an email client and this past month we went back to our roots and dramatically improved the email experience!

  That means, now you can:

  - View all properties for threads and messages (and add your own)
  - Edit the recipients of messages
  - Create custom views (other clients call these folders or splits) by simply filtering based on any property

  Again, we also dramatically improved the UI so its much cleaner and prettier!

  ## 👀 Contact Activity + More Investor Data
  Now on every contact, both people and organizations, you can see a full activity log - all emails, meetings, and property changes from you or anyone in your workspace!

  This makes it super easy to stay on top of what's going on.

  We also added in a few new investor datapoints that are super super useful:

  - **Sectors they invest in**
  - **Rounds they invest in**
  - **Rounds they lead** (no more wondering if an investor you're talking to leads rounds!)

  ## ❤️ Beta Micros
  Micro stands for Micro apps. This month we decided to put our namesake to work to create a few examples of Micros that we envision our users and community will create to solve any problem.

  Pop on over to your Fundraise CRM and see:

  - **Funnel Overview** - speaks for itself
  - **YC Fundraising Bot** - a chatbot trained to give the best fundraising advice like a YC partner. Eventually this will have context on your raise and emails
  - **Fundraising Library** - a few hand picked resources for pulling off an amazing fundraise

  Got any ideas for Micros? Let us know. Over summer we'll be building out the infrastructure to allow anyone to create these.

  ## 😎 DARK MODE
  We cleaned up dark mode so all you night owls can enjoy the product in the wee hours of the night.

  # 🚀 Major Updates: Faster UI, Team Collaboration & Advanced Properties

  Here are some of the biggest things we launched this past month:

  ## 🏃‍♀️ Faster & Prettier CRM UI
  The old CRM was ugly and slow like a... I'll refrain from making any jokes here but feel free to have a chuckle at wherever your mind wandered off to you meanie!

  Anyway, we updated the UI so that its a bit prettier and **MUCH faster**. If you compare speeds of Micro's kanban to other CRMs, we're by far the fastest - some have even called Usain Bold of CRMs.

  ## ❤️ Team Collaboration
  A lot of you have been asking for the ability to collaborate on your CRM with your cofounder, but we didn't want to just launch the obvious stuff like editing permissions and such.

  We took this to the next level with a few killer features:

  - **Live presence** - when multiple people are viewing the same page, we added a little presence indicator to the top and highlight the item they're editing
  - **Contact sharing** - all members of your Team can now view each others email contacts. this is our first step to helping you get that intro to anyone you need
  - **Collaborative CRM automation** - now the CRM automations depend on the activity of anyone the CRM is shared with
  - **Collaborative editing** - obviously we didn't forget the important stuff like being able to edit the same CRM

  ## 🏷️ Advanced Properties
  Properties let you customize your CRM experience. Wanna track the dietary preferences of all of the investors in your funnel? Or maybe update what city they live in so you know who to visit when you're in town? 

  There's a feature for that.

  With our latest properties update we've added:

  - **Tons more property types** - now you can create properties in your CRM with multi-select, checkboxes, dates, and more!
  - **More (investor-specific) enriched datapoints** - check size, investment stage and more enriched properties are now in tens of thousands of investor profiles! You can always update these whenever you want

  ## 🙋‍♀️ Adding New Contacts
  We know its important to track investors even if you haven't connected with them yet, so we launched a feature to allow you to add them to your CRM. 

  And something that is unique to Micro compared to any other CRM, you can add **BOTH people and companies to the SAME CRM view**!
