# 1. Sign In

Visit [app.micro.so](https://appmicro.so) and sign in with your Google account. If you haven't been whitelisted yet, you'll see a message indicating that you need to request access.

<Note>Micro is currently in private beta. You will need to be whitelisted to access the platform. If you do not have access, you can [join the waitlist](https://micro.so/waitlist)</Note>


# 2. Connect Your Accounts

After logging in, you can connect additional accounts to centralize all your communications:

- **Gmail accounts** - Connect multiple Gmail accounts to manage all your emails and contacts in one place.
- **LinkedIn** - Sync your LinkedIn connections and messages.
- **Twitter** - Import your twitter followers to Micro.

And when you invite team members to your Micro workspace, all of your contacts are shared with each other.


<Tip>The more accounts you connect and team members you invite., the more comprehensive your unified workspace becomes. You can always add more accounts later.</Tip>

# 3. Create an App

### Option A: Onboarding Flow
Follow the guided onboarding process when you first sign in to create your first app.

### Option B: Quick Setup
If you skip the onboarding, you can create an app anytime:

1. Press `Cmd+K` (or `Ctrl+K` on Windows) to open the command palette
2. Type "new app" and select it
3. Choose a template that fits your needs
4. You're all set up!

### Adding Records
Once your app is created, you can:
- **Add records manually** - Create new contacts, companies, or deals one by one
- **Import from CSV** - Bulk import your existing data or migrate from another system. Learn more [here](/getting-started/importing-migration)
