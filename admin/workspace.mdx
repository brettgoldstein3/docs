### Overview

Like most other collaboration tools, workspaces are where you collaborate and share data with your team. All data, actions, and settings live within each workspace indepdendently.

### General Settings

You can set a workspace name and logo in the general workspace settings in the top left.

### Workspace Members & Roles

You can manage and invite members to your workspace in the settings page. 

There are two possible roles for members:

- **Admin** - Have the ability to add and remove members and adjust workspace settings and billing.
- **Member** - Can only collaborate within the workspace.

By default, the creator of the workspace is the Admin and may not be changed without contacting support.

### Contact & Data Sharing

By default all people and companies tied to any account (Google, Linkedin, or other account connected) are shared with all members of the workspace.

Individual messages are not shared.

### Billing & Subscription

Today, subscriptions are managed on the account level, so each individual member of your workspace will need to sign in with their own credit card.
