### Overview

Your Micro account is your unique identity that lets you take your data across workspaces.

### Profile Information

Soon you'll be able to update your name, profile picture and other things in settings.

### Sharing with Workspace Members

By default, all people and companies from connected apps are shared with members of your workspace, as well as high-level activity tied to them.

You can divide the left sidebar into two sections

- Private area - everything you see above "Apps" is only accessible by you and includes everything in your workspace that is yours or has been shared with you. So People includes all people that members of your team have shared and your people.
- Shared area - everything below "Apps" are part of your workspace and shared with everyone by default. You can update sharing settings for individual apps in this section to make them private or semi private.

### Connected Apps

You can connect any number of email, calendar and messaging accounts based on your plan. As mentioned, the people and companies from these connected apps are by default shared with members of your workspace. You can disconnect an app any time.

### Billing & Subscription

Subscriptions are managed on the account level today. You can do this by going to Billing.
